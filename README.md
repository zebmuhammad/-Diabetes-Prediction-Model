Here’s a simple way to explain the project:

Introduction:

“This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on their health data, such as glucose level, BMI, and age. It uses a machine learning model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.”

How It Works:

“The model learns patterns from the dataset and uses them to make predictions. For example, it knows that high glucose levels increase the risk of diabetes.”

The App:

“I created a user-friendly app where users can input their health data. The app predicts whether they have diabetes and also calculates their BMI.”

The Code:

“The code loads the trained model, takes user input, makes predictions, and displays the results. It also includes a BMI calculator and explanations for each health metric.”

Results:

“The model’s accuracy is around 78%, which means it’s correct 78% of the time. I also added a confidence level to show how sure the model is about its predictions.”

Future Improvements:

“The model can be improved by using more data or trying other algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost.”
